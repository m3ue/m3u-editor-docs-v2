# Custom Playlists

Custom Playlists allow you to create curated collections of channels, series, and VOD content hand-picked from your existing playlists. This is perfect for creating themed playlists, family-friendly collections, or personalized channel lineups.

## What is a Custom Playlist?

A Custom Playlist is a manually curated collection where you select exactly which content to include:
- Choose specific live TV channels
- Select individual series
- Pick VOD movies and shows
- Organize content your way

Unlike merged playlists that combine entire playlists, custom playlists give you granular control over every item.

## Use Cases

### Curated Collections
- **Kids Playlist**: Family-friendly channels and content only
- **Sports Package**: All sports channels from multiple sources
- **Premium Movies**: Hand-picked VOD content
- **News & Documentary**: Curated news and educational content

### Client-Specific Playlists
- Different playlists for different rooms/devices
- Subscription tier-based content access
- Language-specific collections
- Regional content groupings

### Testing and Organization
- Test channels before adding to main playlist
- Organize channels by category or preference
- Create backup playlists with alternative sources
